{"name":"Anvil Connect","tagline":"Anvil OpenID Connect Provider","body":"# Anvil Connect\r\n\r\n**Anvil Connect** aims to be a scalable, full-featured, ready-to-run\r\n[**OpenID Connect**](http://openid.net/connect/) + [**OAuth 2.0**](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749) **Provider**.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why run your own OpenID Connect Povider?\r\n\r\n* Protect your apps and APIs with a shared identity and authorization service *that you control*\r\n* Provide your users with a seamless authentication experience across several apps, as well as social signin via other providers like Google+\r\n* Authorize third party access to your APIs on a user's behalf\r\n* Be the bedrock of an ecosystem as an identity provider for other developers\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why use **Anvil Connect**?\r\n\r\nWe're building Anvil Connect for small teams like us that want to build fast, grow exponentially and need Identity and Access Management to be a solved problem.\r\n\r\n* Deploy to the cloud in minutes\r\n* Quickly connect your apps and APIs\r\n* It's free and open source\r\n\r\n\r\n### Lightning fast setup\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Install the CLI\r\n$ npm install -g anvil-connect\r\n\r\n# Make a place for your deployment repository to live\r\n$ mkdir path/to/project\r\n$ cd path/to/project\r\n\r\n# Generate a deployment repository\r\n$ nv init deployment\r\n\r\n# Install dependencies\r\n$ npm install\r\n\r\n# Initialize the local database\r\n$ nv migrate\r\n\r\n# Create the first user account\r\n$ nv signup\r\n\r\n# Assign a role\r\n$ nv assign <email> authority\r\n\r\n# Start the server in development mode\r\n$ nv serve\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou should now have an OpenID Connect Provider running in development mode.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Even faster deployment\r\n\r\nIf you're using Modulus.io, deployment is a snap. Create a new project and edit the `issuer` in `config.production.json` to reflect your app's url. Be sure to configure Redis as well. Then set these environment variables in the project administration section:\r\n\r\n* `ANVIL_CONNECT_PRIVATE_KEY`\r\n* `ANVIL_CONNECT_PUBLIC_KEY`\r\n\r\nYou can copy these values from the `.pem` files using `$ nv copy keys/<private|public>.pem`. Be sure to use this command to copy the keys as it will encode the values as expected by Anvil Connect.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ modulus deploy\r\n```\r\n\r\nSupport for other deployment targets is in the works.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Configure and customize\r\n\r\n* [Documentation](https://github.com/christiansmith/anvil-connect/wiki/Documentation)\r\n* [References](https://github.com/christiansmith/anvil-connect/wiki/References)\r\n\r\n\r\n## MIT License\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2014 Christian Smith http://anvil.io\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
